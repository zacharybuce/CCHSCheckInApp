# CCHSCheckInApp
Curbside Check-In App for Clay County Humane Society.

This is a demo version of the app.

This app is meant to take in information from the user and send it via email to the front desk. The user can either be a returning patient or a new patient. If the user is a new
patient then they are asked to fill out a form asking for their personal information. They then fill out a form regarding their pet's information. From there, they are directed to 
the Curbside Check-In form. The user is directed straight to the Curbside Check-In form if they choose returning patient. An email would then be sent to the front desk, informing 
them of the patient outside.

In the demo app, the user is directed to a page containing the information that was just inputted.
